*  Longest Word                                                                        *
*  Using the JavaScript language, have the function LongestWord(sen) take the sen      *
*  parameter being passed and return the largest word in  the string. If there are     *
*  two or more words that are the same length,  return the first word from the string  *
*  with that length. Ignore punctuation and assume sen will not be empty.              *
*                                                                                      *
*  When working on the solution you have to be aware of the directions that says to    *
*  ignore punctuation. That means we need to strip out everything in the string        *
*  except for letters a-z and space.  Once removed I am going to use the sort()        *
*  function for Array to sort each word by length in descending order. The first       *
*  entry in the array is the longest word.                                             *
*    1) Remove anything in string that is not a-z, A-Z or blank                        *
*    2) Convert String to Array                                                        *
*    3) Sort Array in descending order based on length of word                         *
*    4) First entry in sorted array is solution                                        *
